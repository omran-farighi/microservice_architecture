# Thoughts on Filbo

As we have learned so far into the semester, applying microservices can be a very difficult and daunting task. It in constraining in both time and money 
which can be very difficult for start ups to deal with. I believe Adrian said Filbo has a team of five developers so I can't imagine how difficult it has
been on them. I'm sure the payoff is very rewarding, but going into this project and knowing that the hours would be very long and straining, why did the Filbo 
team decide on microservices? Would it have bee easier to gradual build toward microservice architecture the bigger the company got or was it more important
to establish they mindset and dynamics of the company first?
