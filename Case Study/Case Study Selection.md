# Case Study: Zalando- 2015 Experience with Microservices

Zalando's transition into microservices is a real life application of what we are learning in class. The more we learn 
about the differences between a monolith and a microservice, it can be seen happening in this case study. Because this case  
study shows a real application of all the theoretical information we learn, I feel it is very important to further research Zalando's
journey to microservices. It will reinforce the lessons we learn in class because we will have a real life experience to 
to compare to our lessons.
