# Virutal Machines

### Pros:
* Ephemeral machines: quick to create and destroy a virtual machine when finished using it
* Low headspace: doesn't require manual management and configuration of cables, everything is programmable and virutalized
* Can be moved from machine to machine

# Containers

### Pros
* Less wasteful: don't require large chunks of RAM and disk
* Lightweight: can use the host OS
* Only runs processes related to software
* Lack of dependency: each container has its own copy of packages, libraries, and other supporting files

# Physical over Virtual

While virtual machines have clear advantages over physical machines, there are times when those advantages are not fully realized. Virtual machines do not allow you to use any empty RAM space, restricting yourself of resources. If multiple virtual machines are running, the amount of disk space required by one OS will affect the performance of another OS. Unless the user needs to run more than one OS, it wouldn't make sense to partition their physical machine and restrict their resources. A physical machine can also be more secure since there is much more hardware required and cannot be moved form machine to machine.

# Cloud and Microservices

The logic and and concepts behind the containers go hand in hand with the architecture of microservices. Microserivces requires each service to act independently 
of other other services so it is easily manageable. Containers very much in the same way are lightweight groups of processes that are independent of other groups
of processes. Containers also containe their own packages, libraries, and supporting files similar to how microservices have their own database and software.
